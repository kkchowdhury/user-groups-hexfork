# user-groups-hexfork
 Let's begin the process of creating user groups for a website using ReactJS. We'll also use a state management library like Redux to manage the user groups' state.
 Here's a high-level overview of the steps:-
1)Set up your React project
2)Install necessary dependencies
3)Create Redux store, actions, and reducers
4)Create components for user groups
5)Connect components to Redux store

Let's go through each step in detail:-
1)Set up your React project: Create a new React project using Create React App:-

npx create-react-app user-groups
cd user-groups

2)Install necessary dependencies: Install Redux, React-Redux, and Redux Toolkit for state management:

npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit

3)Create Redux store, actions, and reducers: Create a new folder called store inside the src folder. Inside the store folder, create a file called userGroupsSlice.js .
I have attached the code for userGroupsSlice.js file to this repository.
Now, create a file called store.js inside the store folder.I have attached the code for store.js file to this repository.

4)Create components for user groups: Inside the src folder, create a folder called components. Inside the components folder, create two files: UserGroupList.js and AddUserGroup.js .I have attached the codes for both UserGroupList.js and AddUserGroup.js files to this repository.

5)Connect components to Redux store: Update src/App.js to include the components and wrap the app with the Redux Provider.
